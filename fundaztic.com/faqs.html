	The Risk Grade is a Fundaztic.com P2P financing proprietary index of the &ldquo;issuers&rdquo; risk profile.

An applicant&rsquo;s risk grade will determine, amongst other things, the amount of funds that an issuer can raise and the pricing that they must pay.</p>

       <p style="text-align: justify;">
	In general, the biggest risk that an investor would need to bear with is repayment/default risk whereby the issuer may not be able to repay a fund in full. This could be due to a variety of reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Therefore, it is advisable for all investors to make a careful selection of their investment notes by thoroughly going through the profile of the issuer especially the probability of default (PD%), purpose of funding, tenure of business as well as tenure of funding. Most importantly, it is advisable for all investors to select issuers with different risk grades to invest in to diversify the risks. &nbsp;To diversify means to spread your investment across as many notes as possible in terms of number as well as type of issuers.&nbsp; It is not advisable at all for any investor to &ldquo;put all their eggs into one basket&rdquo; by focusing on similar types of issuers because this increases non-repayment risks since the issuers may face similar issues.&nbsp; Although higher risk notes offer higher returns of investments, it is never advisable to put all your investments into these types of notes because of the risk factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Diversification of investment can be done not just by putting in fresh funds but also by using the returns of investments to make new investments.&nbsp; Since Fundaztic&rsquo;s minimum investment amount is only RM50 per note, it is easy to use returns of investments to re-invest and thereby managing the risk of overall risks.&nbsp; Re-investing using your returns of investment allows you to stretch your initial capital further to maximize on returns.</p>

	SMEs that are already registered with SSM who require funding for business related purposes may sign up to be an &ldquo;issuer&rdquo; by completing a simple online application form.

If the application meets all the pre-requisites, the application will be approved and an &ldquo;issuer&rdquo; will then be issued legal documents containing all the terms and conditions of the offer for funding. By accepting the terms, the approved application will then qualify to be listed for funding within a pre-determined period whereby registered &ldquo;investors&rdquo; can invest from as little as RM50 to RM50,000 per investment. If the &ldquo;issuers&rdquo; managed to raise at least 80% of the approved limit within the funding period, then, after a simple pre-disbursement check to ensure on legitimacy of application and business is performed, the funds will be transferred into the account provided by the &ldquo;issuer&rdquo; for its intended usage. Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the &ldquo;issuer&rdquo; to make prompt monthly repayments for the funds that they received. &ldquo;Investors&rdquo; will earn monthly return of investments in the form of interest based on their investment amount. The interest earned will be credited into a trust account and investors may choose to re-invest in new &ldquo;investment notes&rdquo; or request for withdrawal of funds back into the account that they have prior provided. To summarize in a simplistic manner, &ldquo;investors&rdquo; provide funding to SMEs whose application has been vetted and approved by Fundaztic.com and &ldquo;issuers&rdquo; having received funding, makes monthly repayments to service their debt.</p>
